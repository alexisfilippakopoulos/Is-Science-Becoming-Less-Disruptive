# The-Decline-of-Disruptive-Science-and-Technology


---


* Drawing inspiration from paper (1), i try to predict the [CD index](http://russellfunk.org/cdindex/) from 1% of all CrossRef available publications that have abstracts, derived from the [alexandria3k package](https://github.com/dspinellis/alexandria3k).

* For the implementations i opted for an XGBooster and an instance of a pre-trained BERT for masked language modeling.(2)
